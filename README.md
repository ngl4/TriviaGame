# TriviaGame

This is a short multiple choice survey-liked game with a timer. This is a small project to experiment with JavaScript timer function and jQuery show() and hide() methods. click [here](https://ngl4.github.io/TriviaGame/) to play the game!

Here is the Demo:

### Reflection: 

The first issue I encountered is to get the timer to work properly. When the timer gets to zero, answers will be displayed. It is the same when a "submit" button is clicked. I resolved this issue after taking a short break--always really helpful. I placed an if statement inside the decrement function and so when time goes to zero, it will execute the stop function and stop running. 

I have also worked on a second version of this game, [TriviaGame2](https://github.com/ngl4/TriviaGame2). Instead of asking all the questions simultaneously, It will show one question at a time with a timer for each question.
