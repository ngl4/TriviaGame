### Reflection: 

The first issue I encountered is to get the timers to work properly. When the timer gets to zero, everything will be stored and display answers just like when a "submit" button is clickd. I resolved it after taking a short break. I place an if statement inside the decrement function and so when time goes to zero, it will execute the stop function and stop running.
